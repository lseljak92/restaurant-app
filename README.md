#### Restaurant Reviews App

This app is a project from the Udacity Nanodegree "Mobile Web Specialist".


## About

The app consists on a restaurant review application. It features a map which allows the user to explore the diverse restaurants, sorting features such as searching restaurants by neighborhood or cuisine, write reviews.
This project also focuses on an offline-first approach, accessibility (which makes it possible to use the app with screen reader or keyboard only) and responsiveness.

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
